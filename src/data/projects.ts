        longDescription: 'A comprehensive booking management system designed specifically for boutique inns and small hotels. This platform bridges the gap between guest-facing booking experiences and internal property management, offering real-time synchronization, dynamic pricing capabilities, and a complete operational dashboard for hotel staff.',
        techStack: ['Next.js', 'TypeScript', 'Supabase', 'Tailwind CSS', 'Recharts'],
        features: [
            'Real-time room availability & booking engine with instant confirmation',
            'Dynamic pricing system with customizable add-ons (meals, airport pickup, local tours)',

        challenges: 'The primary challenge was designing a system that seamlessly bridges two very different user experiences: the customer-facing booking interface needed to be simple and trustworthy, while the back-office PMS required powerful features for complex hotel operations. Additionally, ensuring real-time data synchronization across multiple touchpoints (booking engine, PMS dashboard, housekeeping tablets) without performance degradation was critical. The system also needed to handle edge cases like overbooking prevention, concurrent booking attempts, and accurate room availability calculations across different timezones.',
        solution: 'Implemented a robust real-time subscription architecture using Supabase\'s PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data integrity and security. The booking engine uses optimistic UI updates combined with server-side validation to provide instant feedback while maintaining accuracy. For the PMS dashboard, I designed an efficient data-fetching strategy with smart caching to minimize load times while ensuring staff always see current information. The system employs database triggers and functions to handle complex business logic like automatic room status updates, booking conflict detection, and revenue calculations. All real-time updates are managed through Supabase subscriptions, allowing multiple staff members to work simultaneously without data conflicts.',
